# STR-VQA
This repository presents the official implementation of STR-VQA, a no-reference video quality assessment model that combines register token-augmented UNet3D saliency prediction and transformer-based temporal modeling. It delivers cutting-edge results on KonVid-1k, LIVE-VQC, and YouTube-UGC with excellent efficiency.
